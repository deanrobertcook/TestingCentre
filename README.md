TestingCentre
=============

A project for learning how ZF2 works, following along with the code from *Learn ZF2: Learning By Example*.

### Adding New Submodules

### PHP CLI Server

The simplest way to get started if you are using PHP 5.4 or above is to start the internal PHP cli-server in the root directory:

    php -S 0.0.0.0:8080 -t public/ public/index.php

This will start the cli-server on port 8080, and bind it to all network
interfaces.

**Note: ** The built-in CLI server is *for development only*.
